# Shop Book server: a plain-language guide

Explanations for studying the server, written as each task is built. The exact contract is in `api.md`; this file explains the **why**.

---

## BE1 Part A: the foundations

### What happens to every request

Every request passes through the same steps, in this order (`src/app.js`):

1. **A request ID** (`requestId.js`). The server gives the request its own random ID (a UUID) and sends it back in the `X-Request-Id` header. Every log line for that request carries it. When something breaks, the trader's Help message includes the ID, so the developer can find the exact request in the logs **without seeing anyone's records**. An ID sent by the phone is ignored, so nobody can make their requests look like someone else's.
2. **A log line** (`requestLog.js`), written when the answer has been sent: time, ID, method, path, status, how long it took. Never the body, the cookies, the headers or the query string, because those can hold passwords, tokens, phone numbers and emails. As a safety net, the logger itself replaces keys such as `password`, `token`, `cookie`, `email` and `phone` with `[removed]` (`logger.js`).
3. **Security headers** (`securityHeaders.js`): small instructions to the browser that close known doors (don't guess file types, don't show the API inside another site's frame, don't pass addresses to other sites, use HTTPS only, don't cache business data).
4. **CORS** (`cors.js`): tells browsers which websites may **read** the API's answers: only the phone app's address.
5. **Reading the body**, at most 1 MB. The exact bytes are kept too (`req.rawBody`): from BE5, each phone signs its requests, and the signature covers these bytes exactly as sent.
6. **The CSRF check** (`csrf.js`), explained below.
7. **The route** itself (from the route registry, `src/routes/index.js`).
8. **Not found / the error handler** (`errorHandler.js`): anything that went wrong becomes the one error format.

### Why the environment is checked at start-up

The server reads its settings (database address, the app's address…) from environment variables. If one were missing, the server might start and then fail on the first sale, which is much worse than not starting. So `src/config/env.js` checks them all with Zod **before anything else** and stops with a list like:

```text
Invalid environment variables:
  - DB_HOST is missing
  - CLIENT_URL has an invalid value (Invalid URL)
See .env.example for what each one holds.
```

It names the variable but **never prints its value**, because the value could be a password. Production has extra rules: the database must use SSL (`DB_SSL_CA_PATH`), and the number of proxies (`TRUST_PROXY`) must be set on purpose.

### The error format

Every error the app receives looks the same: `{ "error": { "code", "message", "fields"? } }`. The **code** is what the app acts on (`RATE_LIMITED` means wait, `INTERNAL_ERROR` means keep the records and retry). The message is plain words for people.

An **unexpected** error (a bug, or the database going away) never shows its details: those could include SQL or a customer's phone number. The app gets "Something went wrong. Reference: …" with the request ID, and the details go to the server's log under the same ID. Even in the log, a database error's message and SQL are left out (they can contain the values being saved); only its type, code and where in the code it happened are kept.

### CSRF, in layers (and why CORS isn't enough)

**CSRF** (cross-site request forgery) is when another website makes your browser send a request to Shop Book, with your sign-in cookie attached, that you never meant to send ("record a repayment"). Three layers stop it:

1. From BE2 the session cookie is `SameSite=Lax`: browsers don't attach it to most requests started by other sites.
2. Every request that changes something (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) must carry `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`. An ordinary form on another website can't add custom headers. A script on another website could only add it after asking the browser's permission through CORS, and our CORS rules refuse every site except the app.
3. If the browser says where the request came from (`Origin`), it must be the app's address. The account endpoints (sign-in, sign-up, password reset; from BE2) go further and **require** the `Origin`. Only in development may it be missing, so Postman works on your laptop.

**Why CORS isn't the protection:** CORS only controls whether another site can **read** the answer. It doesn't stop the request from being **sent**, and a request that's sent can already have changed something. That's why the header and Origin checks exist.

### Trust proxy: whose address is it?

In production a phone's request goes phone → Vercel (the app's rewrite of `/api`) → Render's router → our server. Each proxy adds the address it received the request from to the `X-Forwarded-For` header. Without being told, Express would see only the last proxy's address, and the rate limits would count **every phone as one**. `TRUST_PROXY` says how many proxies to trust, so `req.ip` is the phone's own address. It must not be **too high** either: then a phone could put a fake address in `X-Forwarded-For` and escape the limits. That's why the number is measured in BE1 Part B (with `LOG_PROXY_CHAIN=true` for one test) rather than guessed.

### Rate limits

`src/lib/rateLimiter.js` counts requests per key (an IP address, a login, a user) in fixed windows, for example "10 sign-ins per 15 minutes", and answers `429 RATE_LIMITED` with `Retry-After` when a key goes over. The counts live in the server's memory. That's fine while there's **one** server instance, but a restart resets them, and two instances wouldn't share them. Before running more than one, the counts move to a MySQL table. The limiter is ready now; the routes that use it arrive in BE2 (sign-in, sign-up, password reset) and BE5 (sync, devices).

### Health

`GET /api/health` answers only `{ status, database, version }`, with `ok` or `down`. It answers **200** when MySQL replies and **503** when it doesn't, so a monitoring tool sees the problem from the status code alone. It never says *why* the database is down (no hostnames or error messages), because anyone can call it. The phone app calls it when it opens, partly to wake the free Render server, which sleeps after 15 minutes.

### The route registry and `check:api-docs`

The phone app is built in a separate project that can only read `docs/api.md`. If an endpoint existed but wasn't in `api.md`, or `api.md` described one that didn't exist, the app would be built wrong. So every route is declared in one table (`src/routes/index.js`), and `npm run check:api-docs` (part of `npm test`) compares that table with the `### METHOD /path` headings in `api.md`, failing if either side is missing something.

### Shutting down cleanly

When Render restarts or stops the service, it sends a `SIGTERM` signal. The server then stops accepting new connections, lets requests in progress finish (a sale being saved, for example), closes the database connections and exits (`src/server.js`). If that takes more than 10 seconds, it exits anyway.

---

## BE1 Part B: ready for production

### The database's certificate (SSL)

On Aiven the database is on the internet, so the connection is encrypted (SSL). Encryption alone isn't enough: the server must also know it's talking to **the real** database and not something pretending to be it. Aiven gives a **CA certificate** (`ca.pem`) that proves this, and the connection refuses any database whose certificate doesn't match (`rejectUnauthorized: true`).

The certificate isn't a password, but it belongs to your setup, so it never goes into GitHub. The server accepts it in one of two ways (`src/config/database.js`):

- **`DB_SSL_CA_PATH`**: a path to the file. On your laptop it's kept outside the project folder; on Render it can be a *Secret File*, which Render puts in `/etc/secrets/`.
- **`DB_SSL_CA`**: the certificate's text itself in an environment variable, in case Secret Files aren't available. Some dashboards keep a value on one line, so `\n` in the text is turned back into real line breaks.

Setting both is refused, so it's never unclear which certificate is used. Text that doesn't look like a certificate is refused at start-up too.

### Why production migrations have their own guarded script

A migration changes the shape of the database (new tables, new columns). Run against the wrong database, it could change something it shouldn't. `npm run db:migrate:production` (`scripts/migrate-production.js`) makes that hard to do by accident:

- it reads **only** `.env.production`, and stops if the file isn't there;
- it **doesn't** pass on the terminal's own variables, so a `DB_HOST` left over from another project can't redirect it;
- the file must say `NODE_ENV=production` and pass the full environment check (certificate, `TRUST_PROXY`), so a copied development file is refused;
- it prints the host and database name before it starts, so you see where it's going;
- it allows only two commands: apply migrations, and show their status. Undoing migrations on production is deliberately not offered; a mistake there is fixed by a new migration (fix forward).

### Measuring the proxies twice

`TRUST_PROXY` must match the real number of proxies in front of the server (see "Trust proxy" above). Right now a phone reaches Render **directly**, so that path is measured first. Once the app is on Vercel (FE1), requests also pass through Vercel's rewrite, one more hop, so the measurement is repeated then. The `onrender.com` address stays reachable directly as well, so the re-check also makes sure a direct request with a forged `X-Forwarded-For` can't choose its own `req.ip`.

---

## BE2: accounts

### The tables, and what the database itself guarantees

BE2's migration (`migrations/20261103100000-create-accounts.js`) creates six tables: `User`, `Business`, `BusinessSettings`, `Location`, `Membership` and `EmailToken`. Some rules are enforced by **MySQL itself**, so even a bug in the code can't break them:

- **One phone number, one account; one email, one account** (unique keys on `User.phone` and `User.email`).
- **Phone numbers are always stored as `+233XXXXXXXXX`**, and emails in lower case (`CHECK` constraints), so "024 123 4567" and "+233241234567" can never become two accounts.
- **One active owner per business.** `Membership` has a column MySQL works out by itself, `activeOwnerBusinessId`: the business's ID when the row is an *active owner*, otherwise empty. A unique key on it means a second active owner is impossible. Empty values don't clash, so any number of managers and associates are fine.
- **The business name is 1–60 characters, the receipt note at most 120** (`CHECK` on `BusinessSettings`). The name lives only in the settings row (there's no `Business.name`), so it's typed once at sign-up and changed in one place.
- **Every business table has a `(businessId, id)` unique key** from the start. From BE3/BE4, tables that point at each other use *composite* foreign keys on that pair, so a row can never point at another business's record.

### `runTransaction`: all or nothing

Sign-up writes five rows (user, business, settings, shop, membership) plus the email token. If the server stopped halfway, a business with no owner would be left behind. A **transaction** makes the writes one unit: they're all saved together, or none of them is.

`runTransaction(fn)` in `src/db.js` is the **only** place in the code that opens a transaction (a test scans the code to make sure). Two requests can block each other in the database (a *deadlock*); MySQL then cancels one transaction, which is safe because nothing of it was saved. `runTransaction` simply runs it again (up to 3 times, after a short random wait). If it still can't, the answer is `503 TRY_AGAIN`: temporary, try again later. In BE5, `runOperation` (for sync) is built on top of it.

### Passwords

- **Never stored**, only their **argon2id hash** (`src/lib/passwords.js`). A hash is one-way: you can check a password against it, but you can't get the password back. argon2id is deliberately slow and memory-hungry, so someone who stole the database couldn't try billions of guesses.
- **Rules:** at least 8 characters, at most 128 (long passphrases welcome), and not on the list of the most common passwords (`src/lib/common-passwords.txt`, a plain file you can add to).
- **Sign-in never reveals who has an account.** A wrong password, an unknown phone number and an unknown email all get exactly the same answer. When the account doesn't exist, the server still checks the password against a dummy hash, so even the *time* taken is the same.
- **Rate limits** stop guessing: 10 sign-in attempts per 15 minutes per login and per connection.

### Sessions: the cookie, 30 days and 90 days

After signing in, the phone holds a **cookie** with a signed token (a JWT) saying `{ userId, sessionVersion, issuedAt }` (`src/lib/session.js`). It's signed with `JWT_SECRET`: without the secret nobody can make or change one.

- **HTTP-only:** the app's own JavaScript can't read the cookie. If a malicious script ever got into the app, it still couldn't copy the sign-in.
- **30 days idle:** each signed-in request renews the cookie for 30 more days, so people who use the app daily stay signed in, offline included.
- **90 days absolute:** `issuedAt` is the moment of signing in and never moves. After 90 days the person signs in again, however active. A lost phone can't stay signed in forever.
- **`sessionVersion`** is a counter on the user in the database, checked on every request. Changing a password, phone number or email adds 1, so every other phone's cookie (with the old number) stops working at once. The phone that made the change gets a new cookie with the new number.
- Removing someone from a business (BE3) does **not** change `sessionVersion`: they lose that business only, not their other ones.

### Email links: one-time tokens

Confirming an email and resetting a password work by email link (`src/lib/tokens.js`):

1. The server makes 32 random bytes (the **token**), puts it in the link, and stores only its **SHA-256 hash**. A copy of the database is useless for opening links: you'd need the token itself, which exists only in the email.
2. When the link is used, the server hashes the token again and looks for that hash, unused and not expired.
3. It marks it used with one conditional update ("…where it isn't used yet"). If two requests race with the same link, only one of them changes the row, so the link works **exactly once**, without locking anything.
4. Asking for a new link makes the older ones unusable. Confirm links last 24 hours, reset links 30 minutes.

### Forgot password, without giving anything away

`POST /api/auth/forgot-password` **answers first**, always with the same sentence, and only then (in the background, `src/lib/background.js`) looks up the account and sends the email. So neither the words nor the response time show whether the account exists. A reset link goes only to a **confirmed** email: an unconfirmed address might belong to someone else. Every error in that background work is caught and logged, so it can never crash the server. Setting a new password ends **every** sign-in, on every phone.

### Emails: sent after saving, never lost

The email adapter (`src/lib/email.js`) sends through Brevo's HTTPS API in production, prints the whole email (link included) in the terminal in development, and keeps it in memory in tests. In production the log gets only the template's name and the user's ID, never the address or link.

Emails are sent **after** the database change is saved. If sending fails, nothing is undone. Sign-up and change-email still succeed and say `emailSent: false`, and the person taps **Send the link again** (that endpoint answers `502 EMAIL_NOT_SENT` when it fails, because sending is its whole job).

### Changing your email safely

A new email is kept as **pending** until its link is tapped; the old one keeps working until then. A notice goes to the old address, with the new one partly hidden (`ne***@example.com`), so someone whose account was taken over finds out. If another account takes the address before the link is tapped, confirming is refused and nothing changes.

### Terms

The privacy notice and terms are Markdown files in `legal/` (English and Twi; the Twi files are placeholders until translated). Sign-up records the version accepted and when. If the version ever goes up, people who accepted an older one get `403 TERMS_REQUIRED` on most endpoints until they accept the new one; `me`, sign-out, accept-terms, change-password and the language setting still work, so the app can get them there.

---

## BE3: the team

### Which business? `X-Business` and `requireAuth`

One person can belong to several businesses: their own shop, its practice shop, and maybe another shop they work in. So every business request says which business it's for with the `X-Business` header, and the header is **required**. A missing one is answered `400 BUSINESS_REQUIRED`, so a bug in the app can never quietly land a record in the wrong shop.

`requireAuth` (`src/middleware/requireAuth.js`) then looks up the person's membership **in the database, on every request**:

- no membership in that business (or just an invitation not yet accepted) → **404**, exactly like a business that doesn't exist, so nobody can find out which businesses exist;
- a membership the owner ended → **403 `ACCESS_REMOVED`**, and the phone wipes that business's data;
- the business is closing → **403 `BUSINESS_CLOSING`**;
- a temporary password not yet replaced → **403 `PASSWORD_CHANGE_REQUIRED`**; terms not accepted → **403 `TERMS_REQUIRED`**.

Then `requireRole('owner')` checks the role it just read. The phone's own idea of its role is never trusted: if the owner changes someone's role, it counts on their very next request.

### Removing someone without signing them out everywhere

Removing a member ends their membership in **this** business only (`removedAt` is set). Their `sessionVersion` doesn't change, so they stay signed in and keep working in their other businesses (ADR-19). Their next request to this business is refused, because `requireAuth` re-reads the membership every time. Nothing they recorded is changed. From BE5, their phones for this business are revoked in the same step.

### Temporary passwords

When the owner adds someone new, the server makes a **temporary password** like `k7m4p-q2xnr`: 10 random characters, lower case, without look-alikes (no 0/o, 1/l/i), so it's easy to read out and type on a phone. It appears **once**, in that one answer, which is never cached. The database keeps only its argon2id hash, and it never appears in the logs or in the ChangeLog. The person must choose their own password at their first sign-in (`mustChangePassword`), then accept the terms.

### Invitations: why an existing account isn't "added"

If the phone number already has a Shop Book account (someone who also works in another shop), the owner **can't** be allowed to set its password, or one owner could take over a person's access to another business. So instead:

- the server creates an **invitation** (a membership waiting to be accepted); the account itself isn't touched;
- the owner sees only the **name and number they typed** and "Waiting for them to accept", never the account's real name or email;
- the answer has the same fields as for a new person, only without a temporary password;
- the person sees the invitation in `GET /api/auth/me` at their next sign-in and accepts or declines it. Only they can answer it.

### Resetting a staff member's password, safely

A staff member with no confirmed email who forgets their password asks the owner, who gets a new temporary password for them (all their sign-ins end). If that person **also belongs to another business**, the reset is refused (`RESET_NOT_ALLOWED`): a password works everywhere, so one owner must never be able to set it. They use **Forgot password** by email instead, or ask for help.

### The ChangeLog

Every team change (adding or inviting, accepting, declining, a role change, a password reset, a removal) adds a row to `ChangeLog` **in the same transaction** as the change: who, when, and what it was before and after. Because it's the same transaction, the history can never miss a change or show one that didn't happen. Rows are only ever added. From BE5 the same table records every edit of products, customers and settings.

### The database's state rule for memberships

A membership can only be in one of three states, enforced by a `CHECK` in MySQL: **active**; **invited** (not active, not ended, with an invitation time); **ended** (removed, or declined). An owner can never be an invitation, and the one-active-owner key from BE2 still applies.

---

## BE4: keeping businesses apart

Every shop's records are private: no other business, not even the neighbour, may see or change them. That's protected in **three layers**, so one mistake is never enough to break it.

### Layer 1: `requireAuth` chooses the business from the database

As in BE3: the business comes from the person's own memberships, read from the database on every request, never from what the phone claims.

### Layer 2: `scoped()`, the only way handlers touch business tables

`src/services/scoped.js` gives each business table five methods: `findOne`, `findAll`, `count`, `create` and `update`. Every one of them adds `businessId = <the request's business>` by itself:

```js
const s = scoped(req, models);
await s.Membership.findOne({ where: { id: membershipId } });
// really runs: WHERE id = … AND businessId = <this business>
```

- A query that tries to set its own `businessId` is refused (a bug, answered as a 500).
- `create` sets `businessId` itself; `update` needs a `where` and can never change `businessId`.
- There's **no `destroy`**: business records are only ever deleted by `deleteBusinessData`.
- `update` refuses **permanent records** (sales, repayments… as they arrive), which are never changed.

**Another business's ID is answered exactly like an ID that doesn't exist** (404, same words): a scoped search simply finds nothing. So nobody can even learn that a record exists in someone else's shop.

A test reads the code and fails if any file in `src/routes/` touches a business table directly or runs SQL itself. The few places that genuinely work across businesses (creating a business at sign-up, a person's own memberships and invitations, the "do they belong elsewhere?" check before a reset) live in `src/services/`, each with a comment saying why.

### Layer 3: the database refuses cross-business links (composite foreign keys)

Every business table has a unique key on `(businessId, id)`. When one business table points at another, it does so with **both** columns:

```sql
-- in the migration of a table that points at a product (e.g. SaleItem, BE8):
CONSTRAINT fk_saleitem_product FOREIGN KEY (businessId, productId)
  REFERENCES Product (businessId, id)
```

Now a sale line of business A pointing at a product of business B is impossible: the pair `(A, B's product)` doesn't exist in `Product`, so MySQL refuses the row, even if the code had a bug. **Every later migration follows this pattern** for references between business tables.

The first two (BE4):

- `ChangeLog (businessId, changedBy)` → `Membership (businessId, userId)`: a change in A can only be recorded as made by someone with a membership in A.
- `BusinessSettings (businessId, updatedBy)` → `Membership (businessId, userId)`: settings can only be marked as edited by a member of that business.

**NULL means "a system change".** `changedBy` and `updatedBy` may be empty when no person made the change (later scheduled jobs, BE13 and BE15). MySQL skips a foreign key check when one of its columns is NULL, so such rows are accepted; a test checks it.

### Proving it: `npm run test:isolation`

`tests/isolation/isolation.test.js` builds two businesses, A and B, each with an owner, a staff member, an invitation and a removed member, then:

- tries **every business endpoint** with B's IDs while working in A, and checks the answer is identical to a made-up ID (404) and that B's records didn't change;
- sends `X-Business: B` from A's people (404 everywhere);
- tries to answer B's invitations from A (404);
- inserts rows **straight in MySQL** that would link A to B's people, and checks the database refuses them.

It also **refuses to pass** if a route is marked `business: true` without a case, and another test refuses any route Express has that isn't marked `business: true` or `false`. So every later task must add its own isolation cases, or the build fails.

### Deleting: only two places

Only `deleteBusinessData` (BE15/BE16) deletes business records. The one other kind of delete is **housekeeping** of short-lived technical rows (expired nonces from BE5), and only those listed in `src/services/housekeeping.js`. That list is empty now, and a test pins it, so adding anything needs the owner's OK.

---

## BE4.5: international-ready, Ghana first

Shop Book is built so a business in another country could use it (Decision F-27), but **only Ghana is offered** until another country's legal texts, payment methods and translations are ready. So the code never assumes Ghana; it reads it from the business or from the reference tables.

### The reference tables (`src/locale/`)

Plain data, changed only by a code change with tests:

- **Countries** (launch: GH): dialling code `233`, trunk prefix `0`, 9-digit national numbers with the mobile prefixes, currency GHS, time zone `Africa/Accra`, payment methods cash and mobile money (shown "MoMo"), default language English.
- **Currencies** (launch: GHS): `minorUnits` 2 (pesewas), the symbol `GH₵`, and exactly how to write an amount.
- **Languages** (launch: `en` complete, `tw` draft): anything not translated falls back to English.
- **Payment methods:** `cash`, `mobile_money`.

The phone gets them from `GET /api/reference`.

### Money in minor units, written the same everywhere

Money is always a **whole number of the currency's smallest unit** (pesewas for GHS), in fields ending in `Minor`. Never decimals: `0.1 + 0.2` isn't exactly `0.3` in floating point, and a shop's money must never drift. How many decimals to show comes from the currency table.

`src/locale/money.js` writes an amount using only integer arithmetic: `120050` → "GH₵ 1,200.50", with a **non-breaking space** after the symbol so it never wraps onto two lines. The phone app writes amounts with the same rules (not the browser's `Intl.NumberFormat`, which can differ from one phone to another), so a receipt says exactly the same thing on every phone and on the server.

### Phone numbers in E.164

Every phone number is stored as **E.164**: `+`, the country code, then the number (`+233241234567`). A number typed in local form (`024 123 4567`) is read using a country: the business's country, or the one chosen on the sign-in screen (Ghana by default). The database refuses anything that isn't E.164. One form means one account per number, and WhatsApp links work.

### Each business's country, currency and time zone

A business gets its country at sign-up (Ghana by default), and with it its currency, time zone and payment methods. **Business days use the business's own time zone**, so "today" means the shop's today.

These three are **locked once money has been recorded** (`Business.moneyRecordedAt`, set by the first sale, repayment, debt brought forward, write-off or expense from BE8 on). Changing the currency afterwards would make every stored amount mean something else, and changing the time zone would move past sales to different days. Before that, the owner can change them (`PATCH /api/business/locale`); after it, the answer is `409 CURRENCY_LOCKED`.

### Payment methods per business

Each business lists the methods it uses (`paymentMethods`: cash and mobile money in Ghana). From BE8 a payment in any other method is refused (`PAYMENT_METHOD_NOT_ENABLED`). The sale rules don't change: what was paid is the sum of the payments, whatever their method. Day closes (BE12) check **each method separately**: the drawer for cash, the MoMo balance for mobile money.

### The migration

`migrations/20261107100000-international.js` turned the existing data international without changing its meaning: every existing business became Ghana, GHS and Africa/Accra with cash and mobile money; languages became open tags (values kept); the phone rule became E.164 (existing `+233…` numbers already fit); `defaultCreditLimitPesewas` became `defaultCreditLimitMinor`.

# The phone app

Explanations for studying the app (the frontend project), written as each FE task is built.

---

## FE1: setup and app shell

### What the pieces are

- **Vite** builds the app: it turns the React files in `src/` into a few small files in `dist/` that phones download. `npm run dev` runs it on your computer with instant reloads.
- **React** draws the screens; **React Router** decides which screen an address shows (`/sell`, `/customers`, `/stock`, `/today`, `/more`).
- **Tailwind** styles them with short class names (`bg-primary`, `text-title`). The colours and sizes from `docs/design.md` are defined **once** in `src/index.css` as CSS variables, so no component contains a colour code, and a design change is made in one place.
- **Dexie** is a friendly layer over the phone's built-in database (IndexedDB). FE1 only declares the tables; later tasks fill them.

### Why the app works with no network

The app is a **PWA** (installable web app). `vite-plugin-pwa` writes a **service worker**: a small script the browser keeps that saves the app's own files the first time it opens. After that the app opens from those saved files, even in airplane mode. It **never** saves answers from `/api`: those must always come fresh from the server.

When a new version is published, the service worker downloads it quietly and the app says **"A new version is ready"** with **Update now** and **Later**. It never reloads by itself, and refuses while something is being entered (`src/lib/unsavedInput.js`), so an update can't wipe out a sale halfway through.

### One door to the server

Every request goes through `src/api/client.js`. It always calls `/api/...` on the app's **own** address, never the server's. Locally, Vite's proxy passes `/api` on to your backend; in production, `vercel.json` passes it to Render. Because the browser thinks it's talking to one site, the session cookie works simply, and the security policy can say "talk only to yourself" (`connect-src 'self'`).

The helper never throws for a network or server problem; it returns a result, and `src/api/errors.js` decides what that means, straight from the table in `api.md`. The most important rule there: **no answer, a timeout, or a 5xx is always temporary.** Treating one of those as "rejected" could lose a trader's record; retrying never can.

### The sleeping server

The free server sleeps when unused and can take up to a minute to wake. So when the app opens, it calls `/api/health` in the background (`src/api/health.js`): that wakes the server, and the header shows **"Connecting…"** meanwhile. Requests wait up to 60 seconds. Nothing on the phone waits for it.

### Money without floating point

Computers store numbers like 0.29 inexactly: `0.29 * 100` gives `28.999999999999996`. For money that's unacceptable, so the app never does that. Amounts are whole **minor units** (pesewas for the cedi), and `src/lib/money.js` reads typed amounts **by their digits**: "120.5" becomes the digits "120" and "50", joined into 12050. Formatting goes the other way, also with digits. The tests (`money.test.js`) include the classic traps (0.29, 1.15, 4.35). Quantities work the same way: yards are stored as **half-yard units** (5 = "2.5 yards").

Amounts are shown with a **non-breaking space** after the symbol, so "GH₵ 1,000.00" can never be split over two lines.

### Languages: one list of words per language

All the app's words are in `src/i18n/en.js` and `src/i18n/tw.js`, under the same keys. Screens ask for `t('nav.sell')`, never type words themselves. The chosen language is saved in the phone's `shopbook-app` database, so switching it changes every screen at once and survives closing the app. `npm run check:i18n` checks the dictionaries against each other, including that `{placeholders}` match (a Twi line missing `{n}` would drop a number from the screen).

The app's own name (**Ledga**) is in exactly one place, `app.name`; the install name and the page title read it at build time.

### Security headers (`vercel.json`)

- **Content-Security-Policy:** the browser may run scripts only from the app itself, and talk only to the app's own address. If someone ever slipped code into a page, it couldn't run or send data elsewhere. From FE3 this protects the phone's signing key.
- **Referrer-Policy: no-referrer:** password-reset links carry a token in the address; this stops the address being sent to any other site.
- **X-Frame-Options / frame-ancestors:** no other site can show the app inside a frame (to trick someone into tapping).
- **HSTS:** phones always use HTTPS for the app.

### The icons

The logo SVGs in `public/icons/` are turned into the PNG sizes Android needs by `npm run icons`, which uses Chrome on your computer. The **maskable** icon is a full green square with the drawing in the middle 70%, so Android's round mask never cuts it.

### Twi to check

Every Twi line in `src/i18n/tw.js` is a **draft written by Claude Code** and needs a Twi speaker's review before real traders use it (FE12). For FE1 that is **every key** in the file:

| Key | English | Draft Twi |
|---|---|---|
| `nav.main` | Main menu | Nhyehyɛe titiriw |
| `nav.sell` / `sell.title` | Sell | Tɔn |
| `nav.customers` / `customers.title` | Customers | Adetɔfoɔ |
| `nav.stock` / `stock.title` | Stock | Nneɛma |
| `nav.today` / `today.title` | Today | Ɛnnɛ |
| `nav.more` / `more.title` | More | Nkaeɛ |
| `common.back` | Back | San kɔ akyi |
| `sell.empty` | No products to sell yet. | Nneɛma biara nni hɔ a wobɛtɔn seesei. |
| `customers.empty` | No customers yet. | Adetɔfoɔ biara nni hɔ seesei. |
| `stock.empty` | No products in stock yet. | Nneɛma biara nni sotɔɔ no mu seesei. |
| `today.empty` | No sales today yet. | Wonntɔnee hwee ɛnnɛ seesei. |
| `language.title` | Language | Kasa |
| `language.en` | English | Borɔfo |
| `about.title` | App and server | App ne server |
| `about.appVersion` | App version | App no version |
| `about.serverVersion` | Server version | Server no version |
| `about.checkAgain` | Check again | Hwɛ bio |
| `server.connecting` / `sync.connecting` | Connecting… | Ɛrekɔ so ahyɛ ase… |
| `server.ok` | Working | Ɛreyɛ adwuma |
| `server.down` | Not working right now. Your records are safe on this phone. | Ɛnyɛ adwuma seesei. Wo nkrataa wɔ fon yi so dwoodwoo. |
| `server.unreachable` | Can't reach it right now. Your records are safe on this phone. | Yɛntumi nnu hɔ seesei. Wo nkrataa wɔ fon yi so dwoodwoo. |
| `server.offline` | No internet. Your records are safe on this phone. | Intanɛt nni hɔ. Wo nkrataa wɔ fon yi so dwoodwoo. |
| `sync.sending` | Sending… | Ɛremena… |
| `sync.notSentYet` | Not sent yet | Wɔmmɛmanee |
| `sync.notSentCount` | {n} not sent | {n} wɔmmɛmanee |
| `sync.allSent` | All sent | Wɔde ne nyinaa akɔ |
| `sync.needsAttention` | Needs attention | Ɛhia sɛ wohwɛ |
| `update.ready` | A new version is ready. | Version foforɔ wɔ hɔ. |
| `update.now` | Update now | Fa foforɔ no seesei |
| `update.later` | Later | Akyiri yi |
| `update.finishFirst` | Finish what you are entering first. The update will wait. | Wie deɛ wo kyerɛw no kane. Foforɔ no bɛtwɛn. |
| `update.offlineReady` | Ready to work without internet. | Ɛbɛtumi ayɛ adwuma a intanɛt nni hɔ. |

The words most likely to need a better choice: "Stock" (Nneɛma just means "things"), "More", "Connecting…", "Not sent yet", and whether traders would rather see English words like "server" and "version".

**Length matters too.** On a 360px phone with large text, tab labels have about 70px each: "Adetɔfoɔ" and "Nneɛma" then break mid-word onto a second line, and "Ɛrekɔ so ahyɛ ase…" wraps to four lines in the header. Nothing overlaps, but shorter words (one short word per tab, two or three for "Connecting…") will read better.

## BE5 Part A: phones and signed requests

### Why a phone needs its own key

A sign-in cookie proves "someone signed in as Ama". If it were ever copied off a phone, whoever has it could act as Ama from anywhere. So each phone also gets its **own key pair**, made on the phone by the browser (Web Crypto). The **private key can't be read out**, not even by the app's own code; it can only be asked to sign. The server keeps the **public key**, which can only check signatures.

Every business request is then **signed** (`src/lib/deviceSigning.js`). A copied cookie on another machine is useless: it has no key to sign with. A device ID on its own proves nothing either; only a valid signature does.

**Honest limit:** if malicious script ever ran *inside* the app, it could ask the browser to sign. The app's strict Content-Security-Policy (no outside scripts) is what prevents that.

### Registering a phone (enrolment)

This is the one moment a stolen cookie could be turned into a "trusted" phone, so it needs more than a sign-in:

1. **A challenge:** `POST /api/devices/challenge` gives 32 random bytes, valid 5 minutes, usable once (only their hash is stored, in `DeviceChallenge`).
2. **Proof of the key:** the phone signs the challenge with its new private key.
3. **The password:** `POST /api/devices` sends the public key, the signed challenge and the person's **current password**. The server checks all of it, then gives the phone its **device code** (3 characters such as `K7M`, from 29 letters and digits that can't be confused). Codes are never reused, not even after a phone is revoked, so receipt numbers like `K7M-0042` can never repeat.
4. The owner gets an email: "A new phone was added".

A device ID that already exists is refused (`DEVICE_ID_TAKEN`): a phone never swaps its key. A new key means a new device.

### What the server checks on every signed request (`requireDevice`)

The order is session → business (`requireAuth`) → **device** → role → handler:

1. **The device** must be this person's, in this business, and active. Anything else gets the same answer, `DEVICE_NOT_REGISTERED`, so nobody can probe someone else's phones.
2. **Not locked:** after 20 failed signatures in 15 minutes the phone is blocked for 15 minutes, and the owner sees it. Failures count **only** once the device is confirmed to be the person's own, so one member can't lock out another member's phone.
3. **The time** (`X-Signed-At`) must be within 5 minutes of the server's clock. Phones with a wrong clock still work: every answer carries `X-Server-Time`, and the phone signs with its clock **corrected** by the difference.
4. **The signature** covers the method, the exact path and query, the SHA-256 of the exact body bytes, the device, the business, the time and a nonce. Changing any of them after signing breaks it.
5. **The nonce** (16 random bytes) is saved in `DeviceRequestNonce` in its own short transaction, **before** the request's work. A unique key means two copies of the same request can't both pass, even at the same instant (`NONCE_REUSED`). Expired nonces of that phone are deleted on the same request: the one allowed "housekeeping" delete.

### Revoking a phone

The owner can revoke a lost or stolen phone (`DELETE /api/devices/:deviceId`). Its next request gets `DEVICE_REVOKED`, and the app wipes that business's data. Removing a member from the team revokes all their phones for that business in the same transaction.

### Trying signed endpoints yourself: `npm run dev:sign`

Postman can't sign with a key by itself, so `scripts/dev-sign.js` does it with a **throwaway test key** (kept in `.dev-device-key.json`, Git-ignored; the script refuses to run with `NODE_ENV=production`):

1. `npm run dev:sign -- new-key`
2. In Postman: `POST /api/devices/challenge` (signed in, `X-Business`), then `npm run dev:sign -- register-body --challenge <challenge>`. Paste the JSON into `POST /api/devices`, typing your password where it says so.
3. For each signed request: `npm run dev:sign -- headers --method GET --path /api/team --business <id>`, and copy the four headers into Postman. Each set works once and for 5 minutes.

---

## FE2: sign up, sign in, PIN

### Who is signed in, even offline

When someone signs in, the server's answer (`me`: the person, their businesses and roles, whether they accepted the terms) is saved in the phone's `shopbook-app` database (`src/auth/session.js`). That copy is what lets the app open **with no internet**, needing only the PIN. When the phone is online, the app asks the server again (`GET /api/auth/me`) on opening and on reconnecting, and replaces the copy.

The session itself is an HTTP-only cookie the app can't read. If the server says the session has ended (`401 NOT_SIGNED_IN`: 30 days unused, 90 days old, or the password changed elsewhere), the app **keeps everything** and only shows "Sign in again" above the tabs. Selling carries on.

### What happens after signing in, in order

`src/auth/nextStep.js` decides, from `me` and the phone's PIN record, which screen comes next: replace a temporary password → accept the current terms → answer invitations → "not part of any business" (if there's none) → **set a PIN** (required on each phone) → the PIN lock → the app. It's a small pure function with its own tests, so the order can't drift.

### The PIN

- A 4-digit PIN, set per person on each phone, **never sent anywhere**. Only a PBKDF2-SHA-256 hash is kept (random salt, 150,000 iterations; `src/crypto/pin.js`).
- A PIN has only 10,000 possibilities, so the hash alone wouldn't stop someone who copied the phone's storage. What protects it is the **5-tries rule**: each wrong PIN is counted on the phone *before* the screen reacts (closing the app can't reset it), and the fifth locks the app until the person signs in with their **password, online**. Then they choose a new PIN. Nothing on the phone is deleted.
- The lock comes back when the app opens and after **5 minutes in the background**.

### A different person on the same phone

If someone else signs in on a phone, the previous person's downloaded records (for an owner, cost prices and profit) must not be left for them to see. The rule (decided 6 Nov 2026): a different person may sign in **only when the previous person has nothing unsent**, with no way around it ("Ama has 3 records not sent. Connect to the internet to send them first."). Then the previous person's business data is removed; that removal arrives in FE3 with the sync engine.

### Email links and their tokens

Reset and confirm links carry a one-time token in the address. `src/lib/addressToken.js` takes it out **before the app even starts drawing** (`history.replaceState`), keeps it only in memory, and forgets it once used. So it never stays in the address bar, the history, or a screenshot.

### The privacy notice and terms, safely

The server sends them as Markdown. Instead of turning that into HTML (which could carry code), `src/lib/markdown.js` turns it into a plain tree of headings, paragraphs, lists, bold and italic, and React draws that tree as ordinary text. **Links are never clickable**: an `https:` address is shown after its words, and anything else (`javascript:`, `data:`…) is dropped. Tests prove no link can come out.

### Errors in words

`src/auth/formErrors.js` turns any failed request into words under the right field, or above the button, using only the error **code** from `api.md` (never the server's wording, which is English and may change). No internet, a timeout and a server error all say "try again"; a wrong login always says the same "Wrong phone number, email or password."

## FE3: the sync engine

### The phone's own key

When someone signs in (or signs up), the app makes a **key pair** for the business in the browser (`src/crypto/deviceKey.js`). The private key is *not extractable*: not even the app's own code can read it out, it can only ask the browser to sign with it. It's kept in that business's local database. The app then registers it with the server: it asks for a one-time challenge, signs it, and sends the public key with the person's password. The server answers with the phone's **device code** (like `HKP`), which will start every receipt number.

The password is used once and never stored. For a staff member's first sign-in the server only allows registration after they've chosen their own password and accepted the terms, so the new password waits **in memory only** until then, and is forgotten once registration has been tried, when those screens are left, or as soon as the app goes to the background. If registration couldn't happen (no internet), a banner offers **Register this phone** later.

### Signing every business request

`src/crypto/sign.js` builds the exact seven-line text from `api.md` (method, path and query, SHA-256 of the exact body, device, business, time, nonce) and signs it. The body is turned into text **once**, and that same text is hashed and sent, so the signature always matches what the server receives. A test checks the text against `api.md`'s own example.

Phones often have the wrong time. Every answer carries `X-Server-Time`, and `src/api/clock.js` keeps the difference, so the app signs with the **server's** time. If the server still says the clock is off, or that a nonce was used before, the helper signs again once with a fresh nonce.

### Saving, then sending

`src/sync/outbox.js` saves a change and its **operation** in **one transaction**: both or neither. The operation gets its `opId` right then, and it never changes, even when sent ten times: that's how the server recognises a repeat and answers "duplicate" instead of doing it twice.

`src/sync/engine.js` then **pushes** (sends up to 200 operations, oldest first) and **pulls** (fetches what changed since the phone's cursor):

- **saved / duplicate**: the phone's copy is updated and the operation leaves the outbox, in one transaction.
- **rejected**: it moves to **Needs attention**, marked **Not accepted**, and its record never counts in totals or lists as if it were saved (`countsAsSaved` in `src/sync/records.js`). It's never dropped silently.
- **no answer, a timeout, a 5xx**: *nothing changes*. Everything stays in the outbox and is sent again later. A server error is never treated as a rejection, because guessing "rejected" could lose a record, and retrying never can.
- **Pulling**: each page's rows **and** its cursor are saved in one transaction. If writing fails, the cursor doesn't move and the page comes again. If the server sends a kind of row this app doesn't know yet, pulling stops **without moving the cursor** ("Update the app to keep syncing") while sending carries on; after the update those rows arrive.

### When it syncs

`src/sync/scheduler.js`: on opening, every 3 minutes, right after a save, and when the network comes back. **Only one sync at a time**, even across several open tabs, using the browser's Web Locks. After a failure it waits 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 5 min… plus up to **20% random extra**, and after reconnecting it waits 0–5 s at random, so a whole market's phones don't all wake the sleepy free server at the same instant.

### When the server says no

- **Session ended (401)**: everything is kept; "Sign in again" appears; after signing in, the waiting records are sent.
- **Access removed / phone removed**: only **that business's** data is deleted from the phone (`src/db/wipe.js`), after counting what was still unsent, and a notice says so honestly ("3 records that weren't sent were removed. Tell the shop owner."). Other businesses on the phone are untouched.
- **A different person signs in** (FE2's rule): once the previous person has nothing unsent, their business data is deleted before the newcomer's arrives.

### Checked against the real server (8 Nov 2026)

On the local backend: signing up registered the phone (code `HKP`); a change made online was sent; a change made in **airplane mode** showed "1 not sent" and was sent **once** when the network returned; a change the server refused appeared in **Needs attention** as "Not accepted"; after the session was ended, the waiting change was kept and sent after signing in again. The engine's tests (`src/sync/engine.test.js`, on a fake IndexedDB) also cover a lost answer resent as "duplicate", a failure halfway through a pull, and wiping one business but not another.

### The development-only test screen

`src/features/dev/DevSyncScreen.jsx` (More → "Dev: sync test", only when running `npm run dev`) changes the receipt note, or makes a change the server refuses, to watch sync work before the real screens exist. Production builds leave it out entirely (`import.meta.env.DEV`). It's used again for the two-phone test (FE3.5) and removed in FE12.

## FE3.5: the two-phone torture test

The sync engine has to survive real life before any feature screen is built on it: two phones offline at once, signal lost halfway through sending, the app closed during a save, the same setting changed on two phones, a person removed, a phone revoked, a session that ends, an update with records still waiting. **No feature screens (FE5 onwards) until every case below passes on real phones.**

### Before you start

- [ ] The app is **deployed on Vercel**, and its address opens on both phones.
- [ ] On Render, **`CLIENT_URL` and `APP_URL`** are set to the real Vercel address.
- [ ] The backend's **proxy re-check** is done (server plan, BE1 Part B, "Proxy hops, measured twice") and `TRUST_PROXY` updated.
- [ ] The backend's **fix for the pull** (`500 INTERNAL_ERROR` on every page with rows, found on 8 Nov 2026) is deployed on Render.
- [ ] Two Android phones (or one phone and a laptop browser), each with the app installed from the Vercel address, and you know the owner's phone number and password.

### Rehearsal on the computer (8 Nov 2026)

Three separate Chrome profiles played three phones (the owner on phone A and phone B, a sales associate on phone C), against the **local** backend only, through `npm run dev`. Changes were made with the development-only test screen (More → "Dev: sync test", which only exists in `npm run dev`).

**First runs:** every pull with rows answered `500 INTERNAL_ERROR`. The backend project fixed it the same day.

**Final results, with the fixed server (8–9 Nov 2026). Every case passed:**

| Case | Result |
|---|---|
| Set-up: the owner on two phones, each with its own key | **Passed** (for example codes `UZ4` and `CRV`) |
| 1. Both offline, a different change on each, then reconnect: everything on both, once | **Passed**: both phones show both changes; version 19 → 21 |
| 2. The network cut while sending (the server saved it, the answer was lost) | **Passed**: the change stayed in the outbox, was sent again and applied once; version 23 → 24 |
| 3. The app closed in the middle of a save | **Passed**: after reopening, the change was whole and waiting, then sent; version 25 |
| 4. The same setting changed on both phones offline: the last one sent wins everywhere | **Passed**: both phones ended with phone B's value; version 21 → 23. `ChangeLog` (read by the backend project, 9 Nov): phone B's change (v22 → v23) is marked `conflict: true`. **The app plan says "the earlier one" is marked: see "Open question" below** |
| 5a. A person removed by the owner: wiped, and the notice counts the unsent records | **Passed**: "You no longer have access to FE3.5 Test Shop, so its records were removed from this phone. 1 record that wasn't sent was removed. Tell the shop owner." (wording corrected after the run); no business database left on the phone |
| 5b. A phone revoked by the owner: wiped on its next sync | **Passed** |
| 6. Session ended while offline: kept, sent after signing in again | **Passed**: "Sign in again" shown, the change kept, sent once, and the other phone received it; version 25 → 26 |
| 7. An app update with a record not sent: nothing lost | **Passed**: the update prompt appeared, and after **Update now** the record was still waiting, then sent once; version 26 → 27. The API was blocked to keep the record unsent, and the "new version" was a copy of the build with its service worker file changed |
| Staff first sign-in registers the phone with the kept password | **Passed** (code `XBF`) |
| A staff phone's settings change is refused → "Needs attention" | **Passed**: "Not accepted", "Tell the shop owner." |

**What this doesn't prove:** these were Chrome profiles on one computer with simulated network loss, so the real-phone checklist below is still required. FE5 stays blocked until it passes.

**What the rehearsal changed in the app:**
- While syncs keep failing, the header chip shows "Connecting…" until one succeeds, so a phone never looks up to date when it can't fetch other phones' changes.
- When the owner removes someone, their app can learn it from "who am I" (`GET /api/auth/me`) **before** any sync gets `ACCESS_REMOVED`. It now wipes that business's data in that case too, with the same notice and unsent count (`src/auth/session.js`, tested in `session.test.js`). Before this fix, the removed person saw "You're not part of any business any more" but the shop's records stayed on their phone.

### Open question: which change gets the conflict mark?

The app plan (FE3.5) says `ChangeLog` marks "the earlier one" `conflict: true`. The server marks the **later** change, the one that arrived with an out-of-date `baseVersion` (it overwrote something it hadn't seen). `api.md` only says the server "records that as a conflict in its history". Waiting for a decision on which to update.

### On real phones (waiting for me)

Use the deployed app on two phones signed in as the **owner** (phone A and phone B), and a third person as a sales associate for 5a. "Airplane mode" means the phone's own airplane mode. Each change is made in More → Business settings once it exists; until then a development build is needed for the test screen (ask Claude Code to prepare one).

| # | Steps | Pass when | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Both phones in airplane mode. Phone A changes the receipt note, phone B the shop phone. Turn airplane mode off on both, open the app, wait a minute (or Sync now). | Both phones show **both** changes; Sync status on both says "All records sent"; nothing appears twice. | Waiting for me |
| 2 | On phone A, make a change, tap Sync now, and switch airplane mode **on** while the chip says "Sending…". Then switch it off. | The change is on the server once (phone B shows it once); phone A's outbox empties; nothing in "Needs attention". | Waiting for me |
| 3 | On phone A, make a change and close the app straight away (swipe it away). Open it again. | The change is either fully there (and then sent) or not there at all; never half a record. | Waiting for me |
| 4 | Both phones in airplane mode. Both change the **same** setting to different values. Reconnect phone A first, wait for it to sync, then phone B. | Both phones end with **phone B's** value. The backend confirms `ChangeLog` has the conflict mark (which change it's on: see "Open question" above). | Waiting for me |
| 5a | The owner adds a sales associate; the associate signs in on a third phone (own password, terms, PIN). The associate goes into airplane mode and makes a change. The owner removes the associate. The associate turns airplane mode off. | The associate's phone says it no longer has access and **how many unsent records were removed**; the business's data is gone from that phone. | Waiting for me |
| 5b | The owner revokes phone B (once the phones screen exists in FE4; until then, ask Claude Code). Phone B opens the app with internet. | Phone B says "This phone was removed from…" and the business's data is gone from it. | Waiting for me |
| 6 | Make phone A's session end while it's in airplane mode (for example change the password on phone B, which signs out other phones), then on phone A make a change offline. Turn airplane mode off. | Phone A keeps working and shows "Sign in again"; after signing in, the change is sent once. | Waiting for me |
| 7 | With phone A in airplane mode and a change not sent, publish a new version of the app; when phone A shows "A new version is ready", tap **Update now**. Then turn airplane mode off. | After the update the change is still "not sent", then it's sent once; nothing is lost. | Waiting for me |
| 8 | On the associate's phone, try to change a business setting (development build). | It's refused and appears in "Needs attention" as "Not accepted", with "Tell the shop owner." | Waiting for me |

When you've done them, paste what you saw and Claude Code will record the results here.

### Twi plural forms to check

Texts with a number now have one form for 1 and one for every other number. `t('pin.wrong', { count: 3 })` picks the form using the language's rule in `src/i18n/languages.js`, and `npm run check:i18n` fails if a plural is missing a form, or if the code counts a text with no plural forms. **These Twi forms are drafts by Claude Code for a Twi speaker to check, along with the rule itself: is "one" only for exactly 1, and is one form each for 1 and for more the right split in Twi?**

| Key | English | Draft Twi | Checked |
